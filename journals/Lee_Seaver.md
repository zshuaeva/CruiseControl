# THE HISTORY OF CRUISE CONTROL

In the early days of our Cruise Control venture, we began our journey with a single purpose: to lay a solid foundation for our grand vision. Guided by a clear goal, we set forth to craft a user story that would steer our development course. We gathered around, exchanging thoughts and ideas, ensuring that our pursuit would lead us to the most fitting Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for our concept.

With the MVP firmly in place, we turned our attention to the creation of a wireframe, a blueprint to breathe life into our vision. Iteration after iteration, we refined every detail until we arrived at the finest version of our wireframe.

Upon the completion of the wireframe, Nick and Josh dedicated an entire day to the critical task of configuring and fine-tuning the Docker containers, ensuring seamless operation and integration within our project's infrastructure.

Our next endeavor involved crafting issues on our GitLab board, a compass to keep us on the right path and maintain steady progress throughout the week. With a meticulous approach, we divided our workload into smaller, more digestible tasks, preventing our resources from becoming overwhelmed.

As we ventured into the second week, our focus shifted towards implementing the Fast-API framework and establishing the Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) endpoints for our Cruise Control concept. Lee, in particular, devoted his efforts to crafting a comprehensive CRUD system, which would serve as an example for the rest of the team. His work provided guidance and inspiration for those who might have been uncertain of their next steps.

We invested many hours, testing our handiwork to ensure a flawless operation. In our quest to streamline the development process, we fashioned a base-template, a trusty tool for future projects, saving us precious time and guaranteeing consistency in our coding practices.

We gathered once more to discuss and refine the various features of our concept, taking heed of each other's feedback and making the necessary adjustments. Our goal, to build something of value and user-friendly, guided us as we scrutinized every detail.

During that week, we made remarkable progress and completed the lion's share of the tasks on our GitLab board. Our concept began to take form, and we held onto our optimism as we continued our development journey.

In the latter stages of week 14, we turned our attention to the pivotal matter of Authentication and Authorization for our Cruise Control concept. The team, steadfast in their determination, worked relentlessly to seamlessly integrate this essential component. Among us, Josh and Lee played a key role in the coding aspects, ensuring top-notch security and privacy for our users.

Amidst this daunting task, Lee rose to the challenge, committed to forging a complete CRUD system from back-end to front-end with React. He embarked on the creation of Authentication, Login, and Logout, joined by Joshua in the morning and working solo in the afternoon on March 30th. Our team faced numerous obstacles that demanded unwavering persistence and problem-solving prowess.

Undaunted by the technical hurdles, Lee pressed on, focusing his efforts on crafting a user and login function with Swagger. He dedicated himself to the task, ultimately succeeding in creating an automated migration system on April 1st.

On April 2nd, Lee and Joshua combined their collective wisdom, examining the authentication and user components in-depth. They skillfully restructured the database schema to accommodate both Client and Tech permissions, devising new client and tech routes and queries. Together, they laid the groundwork for a robust and scalable system.

As our Cruise Control project advances, our team remains steadfast in our mission to deliver an unparalleled user experience and push the boundaries of innovation in the industry.
