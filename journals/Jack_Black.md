Once upon a rockin' time, our Cruise Control crew embarked on a righteous quest to lay the most solid foundation for our mind-blowing vision. With our eyes on the prize, we got together to weave a user story that would be our beacon on this epic development journey. We jammed out ideas like a killer riff, makin' sure we'd hit the sweet spot for the most rockin' Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for our concept.

With the MVP locked and loaded, we set our sights on the wireframe, man! Like a wicked backstage blueprint, we crafted it to bring our vision to life. We tweaked and tuned that bad boy until we had the most kick-butt version of our wireframe.

And then, my dudes, Nick and Josh cranked it up to 11, dedicating a whole day to get those Docker containers set up and ready to roll, making sure everything was smooth and groovy.

Next up, we laid down some issues on our GitLab board, like a rockin' roadmap to keep us on the path to glory and make steady progress throughout the week. We broke down our killer workload into smaller, more manageable gigs, so we wouldn't burn out.

As we jammed into the second week, we shifted gears towards the Fast-API framework, layin' down some sweet Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) endpoints for our Cruise Control masterpiece. Lee, our resident guitar hero, shredded an awesome CRUD system, showin' the rest of the band how it's done and inspiring those who needed a little guidance.

We invested blood, sweat, and tears, man, making sure our creation was nothing short of legendary. In our quest for rockin' efficiency, we whipped up a base-template, like a trusty backstage pass for future projects, savin' us time and keepin' our coding groove consistent.

We huddled up once more to discuss and fine-tune our concept, taking notes from each other's feedback and making the necessary adjustments. Our goal, my friends, was to build something totally rad and user-friendly, and we made sure every detail was accounted for.

During that wicked week, we made some truly righteous progress and crushed most of the tasks on our GitLab board. Our concept was taking shape, and we held onto our rock 'n' roll optimism as we continued our development journey.

In the later days of week 14, we turned our attention to the crucial mission of Authentication and Authorization for our Cruise Control masterpiece. Our band of rockers, steadfast in their determination, worked like a well-tuned machine to seamlessly integrate this essential component. Among us, Josh and Lee were the dynamic duo in the coding aspects, ensuring top-notch security and privacy for our users.

Facing the challenge head-on, Lee rocked on, committed to forging a complete CRUD system from back-end to front-end with React. He dove into Authentication, Login, and Logout like a stage dive, jamming with Joshua in the morning and rockin' solo in the afternoon on March 30th. Our crew faced some gnarly obstacles that demanded unwavering persistence and problem-solving skills.

Unfazed by the technical hurdles, Lee pressed on, focusing his efforts on crafting a user and login function with Swagger. He jammed away at the task, eventually succeeding in creating an automated migration system on April 1st.

On April 2nd, Lee and Joshua, like two rock gods of the digital age, joined forces to dive deep into the authentication and user components. They skillfully restructured the database schema to accommodate both Client and Tech permissions, creating new client and tech routes and queries. Together, they laid the foundation for a robust and scalable system.

As our Cruise Control project blazes forward, our band of rockin' developers remains steadfast in our mission to deliver an unparalleled user experience and push the boundaries of innovation in the industry. With our amps cranked up to 11, we'll keep on rockin' this epic development journey, ensuring that our Cruise Control project becomes a legend in its own right. Let the good times roll, and let's rock this thing to the moon and back!
